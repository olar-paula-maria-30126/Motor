# Motor
This project presents a microcontroller-based system for controlling a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with real-time data feedback. The system performs precise rotations and returns the motor to its original position. A 16x2 I2C LCD displays key parameters such as angular position, velocity, and acceleration. Users can dynamically adjust the motor speed using a potentiometer, with updates shown both on the LCD and Serial Monitor. Core components include an Arduino, stepper motor with driver, LCD, and potentiometer. The project highlights real-time motion tracking, user interaction, and efficient use of embedded systems for motion control applications.
